# Session Widget Backups

This folder contains backup versions of the SessionWidget for reference:

## Backup History
- **Original Version**: Basic session widget with simple state management
- **Simplified Version**: Streamlined version with reduced complexity
- **Enhanced Version**: Advanced version with comprehensive session tracking

## Current Implementation
The active SessionWidget uses a **modular architecture** located in `./SessionWidget/` with:
- Individual component modules (Header, Target, Activity, Status, States)
- Centralized data management hook (useSessionData)
- Type-safe interfaces from `../interfaces/session.ts`
- WebSocket integration via `../hooks/useUnifiedWebSocket.ts`

## Backup Files Status
Backup files were causing TypeScript compilation errors due to path dependencies and have been cleaned up. 
Reference implementations can be recreated from git history if needed.

*Created: August 30, 2025 - Part of modular refactoring*
